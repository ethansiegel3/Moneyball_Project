Implementation of code to see what helps various MLB teams win in the postseason
I used various statistics used in MLB seasons, such as: Wins, Losses, OPS, OPS+, and Payroll, to help determine what drives a team to winning a championship.
Based off of the book "Moneyball" and movie by the same name, I wanted to implement the code myself.
